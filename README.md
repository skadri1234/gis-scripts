THIS IS A REPOSITORY OF MY (SHAFEEQ KADRI) PYTHON SCRIPTS THAT WERE WRITTEN BETWEEN AUGUST TO DECEMBER 2023, FOR A GRADUATE LEVEL PYTHON SCRIPTING FOR GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS CLASS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT.
THE FILES YOU SEE HERE ALL STARTED OUT AS TEXT FILES WITH COMMENT BLOCKS DIRECTING ME TO COMPLETE THE SCRIPT IN ORDER FOR IT TO FUNCTION AS DESIRED. SOME SCRIPTS HAVE MY NAME IN A TITLE BLOCK AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE SCRIPT, AND SOME DO NOT. ANY SCRIPT THAT ISNT EXPLICITLY STATED TO BE FROM ANOTHER SOURCE IS VERIFIED TO BE MY ORIGINAL WORK. SOME SCRIPTS ARE MODULE FILES THAT ARE TO BE IMPORTED INTO SOME OF MY SCRIPTS IN
ORDER FOR THEM TO RUN, THESE MODULE FILES WERE IN LARGE PART SUPPLIED BY MY PROFESSOR TO BE USED FOR THE SCRIPTS. THERE ARE ALSO ZIP FILES WITH DATA THAT MANY OF THE SCRIPTS RUN ANALYSIS ON. THESE SCRIPTS ARE
MEANT TO ACCOMPLISH GEOSPATIAL DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS TASKS, LARGELY USING THE ARCPY MODULE TO RUN THE SCRIPTS WITHIN ARCGIS PRO.
